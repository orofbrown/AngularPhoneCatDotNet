# AngularPhoneCatDotNet
The AngularJS PhoneCat tutorial project with a C# backend

This is a "port" of AngularJS tutorial "PhoneCat" project, replacing the node.js backend with an lightweight ASP.NET MVC backend. The server side code is lighter-weight than a typical MVC backend because the Angular frontend does all the data processing and gives you the MVC structure that you would need, all in a single-page app. All we really need the backend to do is serve up the content. This is especially useful if you already know .NET/C# and you don't want to take the time to set up all of the dependencies that the original PhoneCat app requires (node.js, npm, bower, jasmine, etc.). Hopefully, you will find this helpful for learning some AngularJS concepts.
